# Forest-Cover-Type-classification
This project uses the Cover Type dataset to predict the type of forest cover based on cartographic variables such as elevation, slope, soil type, and wilderness area.

📂 Dataset

The dataset is built-in from Scikit-learn (fetch_covtype) or available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository
.

It contains 581,012 instances and 54 features.

Target variable: Cover_Type (1–7)

1 = Spruce/Fir

2 = Lodgepole Pine

3 = Ponderosa Pine

4 = Cottonwood/Willow

5 = Aspen

6 = Douglas-fir

7 = Krummholz

⚙️ Features

Elevation, Aspect, Slope

Horizontal & Vertical Distance to Hydrology

Soil Type (40 binary columns)

Wilderness Area (4 binary columns)
Goal

Classify the type of forest cover based on environmental and geographic features.

Evaluate different ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, etc.).

🛠️ Tech Stack
